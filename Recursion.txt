Recursion Theory

Consider the following structure:

  D := A | B | C
  A := Rm D Rn
  B := Rp D Rq
  C := Rx

Definitions:

  D is a decision point.
  A and B are recursive rules.
  C is a non-recursive rule.

Axiom:

  A recursive path in a grammar must always include a decision point that has a non-recursive member.

Consider Rm -> D in Rule A:

  The entry point to D will be (Rm U Rp).
  The next symbols in the stream will be in (Rm U Rp) or (Rx), where
   
    (Rm U Rp) indicates recursion, and
    (Rx) terminates recursion
    
  Rule A should be pushed on the stack for all transitions (Rm U Rp U Rx).
  
Consider D -> Rn in Rule A:

  Due to the recursion of (Rm U Rp), (Rx) must be the exit symbol from D.
 
  (Rn U Rq) exit by popping the stack.
